# Stop a Bit

**Stop a Bit** is an application to remind people that they need to stop hard work and get some rest.
It uses a technique called [Gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) to encourage workers to stop.

This application is an example created during the [\<nlw\/\> #4](https://nextlevelweek.com), an event promoted by the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) team.
